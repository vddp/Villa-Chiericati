<h1>Villa Chiericati, designed by Andrea Palladio</h1>

<p>Villa Chiericati (also known as Villa Chiericati-Rigo) is a villa at Vancimuglio in the Veneto, northern Italy. It was designed for Giovanni Chiericati by the architect <strong>Andrea Palladio</strong> in the early 1550s. Palladio also designed the family's town house Palazzo Chiericati in Vicenza.</p>

<h6>In 1996 UNESCO included the villa in the World Heritage Site City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto.</h6>

<h2>Architectural details</h2>
<p>The villa is square. A portico projects from its principal facade. (This was the first time a temple pronaos had been incorporated into a villa's design). The principal rooms are built upon a piano nobile above a semi-basement. The upper floor is very much of secondary importance. The design of the villa was to be the prototype for Palladio's later works at the Villa Rotonda and the Villa Malcontenta.</p>

<h2>Historical notes</h2>
<p>Work on the villa stopped after the death of Palladio's client. It was not finally completed until after it had been purchased by Ludovico Porto in 1574. In 1584 he employed the architect Domenico Groppino, who had collaborated with Palladio on other projects, to complete the villa.

There is some debate as to the extent Groppino influenced the eventual design of the building. While the portico is undoubtedly by the hand of Palladio himself, the position of the windows is at variance with the architect's own advice in I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura, where he warns against placing windows near the corner of a building lest it weaken the structure (the villa does in fact reveal signs of settlement here).</p>

<h2>Plan and cross section</h2>
<h3>Plans used as reference materials, by Ottavio Bertotti Scamozzi, 1781<h3>
<p><img src="resources/photos/Villa_Chiericati_plans.jpg" alt="Villa_Chiericati_plans"></p>



<h1>The Project</h1>
<p>The project, developed for the final exam of the <a href="http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~paoluzzi/web/did/graficacomp/2012/">Computational Graphics course</a>, consists in the generation of the 3D Model of the Andrea Palladio's "Villa Chiericati". The project uses the <a href="https://github.com/cvdlab/plasm.js">Plasm.js</a> platform framework and runs on Google Chrome web browser.</p>
<p>The project source code is hosted on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/261921/blob/master/final-project/Villa_Chiericati.js">here</a></p>

<h2>Working process</h2>
<p>At first I have spent some time to examine the plan and the cross section and to gather photographic documentation in order to completely understand the structure of the building.</p>
<p>For generate such a complex building it's necessary to divide it into hierarchical parts, after it's necessary to choose some reference parts and start the modeling work with those. The model was splitted into pieces modeled independently. After a careful planning for a design idea I have chosen to decompose the building in four hierarchical parts</p>

<h2>Model decomposition</h2>
<p>The Villa, for it's construction, was divided into distinct tiers, representing the hierarchical parts:
  <ul>
    <li> The basement</li>
    <li> The main floor, the external walls and the ceiling</li>
    <li> The roof and some complex parts such archs and covering elements</li>
    <li> The decorative elements</li>
  </ul>
This subdivision express a iterative way of work, in fact the building follows a bottom-up approach: from the simplest elements to the complexes ones.</p>
<p>For all the hierarchical tiers were used all the operators and functions used during the course, "squared" elements were modeled with the <code>SIMPLEX_GRID</code> primitive while curved surfaces and solids were made with transfinite Bezier <code>BEZIER</code> and transfinite Hermite <code>CUBIC_HERMITE</code> mapped on appropriate domains. Moreover the affine transformations Translate <code>TRANSLATE(dims)(values)(object)</code>, Scale <code>SCALE(axis)(values)(object)</code> and Rotate <code>ROTATE(dims)(angle)(object)</code> were used for the building and the placement of all the decorative elements.</p>
<p>The project source code is hosted on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/261921/blob/master/final-project/Villa_Chiericati.js">here</a></p>

<h2>Preparatory work</h2>
<p>I have made some preparatory sketches og some elements modeled, with measures and references in order to proceed with a clear schema of the item to construct</p>
<p><img src="resources/sketches/vddp_sketches.jpg" alt="vddp_sketches"></p>
<p>For the complexest elements, for example in which more than one bezier curves should be used, I found very useful to prepare a rough sketch of the part to model</p>
<p><img src="resources/sketches/sketch_compared_with_snapshot.jpg" alt="sketch_compared_with_snapshot"></p>

<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>I have used the fact that the Villa is symmetric about the <strong>yz-plane</strong>, it has given the possibility to construct a section of the model that should be reflected with the affine <code>SCALE</code> transformation in order to obtain the complete model. Moreover this choice allows to visualize a cross section of the constructed item, which gives important visual reference.</p>
